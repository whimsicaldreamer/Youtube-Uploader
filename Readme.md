# Youtube Uploader

##### A simple project to handle video uploads to youtube.

I created this project to save my time (actually am lazy) from uploading video files to youtube, repeatedly everyday.

#### Setup  

- Create your google api credentials for youtube by going into google console
- Download the json file and rename it to **credentials.json** and put in the same directory of this project.
- Change the `folderPath` in `main.js`

#### How to run?  

Go to your project terminal and run:  

`node main.js`
